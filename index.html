            <div class="aboutme">
                <p>My name is Nick Shahbaz, and I am a Bachelor of Science student in Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University. I am highly skilled in a variety of programming languages, including Python, C++, C, C#, JavaScript, HTML, and Swift, with a deep enthusiasm for developing innovative, real-world solutions through technology. I am actively seeking an internship or job opportunity for the upcoming summer to expand my professional experience and apply my technical expertise in a collaborative environment.</p>
                <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy activities that challenge my mind, such as gaming and solving puzzles, which align with my passion for problem-solving and analytical thinking. I also share a strong bond with my Maltese puppy, Leo, who brings a great balance to my life outside of work and studies. I am excited to bring my skills, curiosity, and enthusiasm for computer science into meaningful professional experiences.</p>

                        <p class = "subtext">I developed a mobile game for iOS(android coming soon) from the ground up, using Swift as the primary programming language. Responsible for every element of the project, I designed the visuals, created the UI, and implemented all underlying calculations. After completing the app, I successfully published it on the Apple App Store as a sole proprietor. This project spanned the entire summer, during which I both learned Swift and crafted a fully functional game, ultimately managing the technical, creative, and publishing processes independently.</p>

Using GitHub, he initiated the project repository, while I created my own branch through forking. I then made individual contributions and submitted pull requests, which allowed him to review and merge updates seamlessly. This project, which took approximately a week to configure, was instrumental in enhancing our collaborative skills and emphasizing the practical value of GitHub in team-based development.</p>
